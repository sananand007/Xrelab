- Image Classification using Deep Gradient Boosted CNN, Classification problem of Unlabelled Test images .
	Dataset Used : Kaggle
	DeepSat (SAT-6) Airborne Dataset
	405,000 image patches each of size 28x28 and covering 6 landcover classes

Boost CNN - https://github.com/mmoghimi/BoostCNN
Group NormalizationYuxin Wu and Kaiming HeEuropean Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018 (Oral). Best Paper Honorable MentionarXiv   code/models   slides
	- Validate Group Normalization using same Dataset
 Quality is important [2 months]






- Image Synthesis using GANs 
	AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Network, Generate Image from text then use GAN to make it realistic
- Hand Pose estimation - https://github.com/xinghaochen/awesome-hand-pose-estimation --> Very tough but big research based
	Data Sets - ICLV - https://labicvl.github.io/hand.html
	Topics of Interest - http://icvl.ee.ic.ac.uk/hands17/
	http://handtracker.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/GANeratedHands/
	This is fairly A difficult problem in the time provided, But this is a very good usable idea and I would like to do this for a long term project
